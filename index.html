    Welcome to Cuba. This webpage is designed to showcase all of the photos I took while I was visiting my uncle in Havana, Cuba in May of 2013.  My family and I were invited down to stay with my uncle and aunt for a week and a few days in their estate in Havana.  My Uncle Jay was the Executive Chief of Mission for the Swiss Embassy in America and after his success in dealing with the Venezuelan government prior to this assignment, his expertise was needed in Havana.  Instead of retiring then, he took on this assignment and I am so glad he did because my family and I were able to go on this wonderful trip.  I'm sure you are wondering how we were allowed to go in the first place.  Well, we had some ties with the government through my uncle and he basically works for the department that issues visas so that was a big help as well.  I am so thankful that I was fortunate to go on this trip with my family and experience the culture, architecture, and lifestyle of the city of Havana and I hope to share my experience through this website in pictures that I took along my journey.  Enjoy! </footer>
