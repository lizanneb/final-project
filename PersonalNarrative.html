            For my Final Project, I chose to showcase the photos I took while on vacation to Havana, Cuba in May of 2012.  My site has a home page where there are four categories of photos: House, Havana, Events, and Sites.  There is also a short summary in the footer of the main index which tells an overall background of the trip and where and how the photos were taken.</p>
<p>The main heading on the home page is Cuba Libre!  It was a term we used a lot on our trip so I thought it would be fun and appropriate to make that the Title on the homepage.  I used a google font for all of the headings in my project called Permanent Marker.  For other text including the footer on the homepage and the paragraphs on the pages with photos I used a font called Handlee.  I chose the Permanent Marker font because when I was choosing the font for the first header, Cuba Libre, I wanted a font that looked like someone had rebelliously painted it by hand on a wall in Havana during the revelution.  I liked the font and how bold it was, so I used it for all the headings.  I chose the Handlee font because it was sort of fancy but still readable.  It almost looked like handwriting but it was neat enough that it was still clear in a small font size.  </p>
<p>Each photo on the main index links to another page which displays all of the photos in that category.  Each category has a thumbnail picture; The ‘House’ category has a picture of the estate in which we stayed in while we were in Cuba.  On that page, all of the photos of the inside and outside of the house are in an array.  Each photo can be clicked and that will lead to another page with the enlarged image on it.  At the top of each category page, there is a small description of the photos. This is also written in the Handlee font.
The background I chose for my project was a neutral beige or tan parchment-like pattern that I found on subtlepatterns.  This background was not too busy because I didn’t want it to distract the viewer from the content of the page which is the photos.  To be consistent, I used this background for all pages of my website, including the individual category pages.  This added fluidity to the transitions to different pages on my site.</p>
<p>When it came to positioning the pictures on each category page, I spaced them somewhat close together because there were quite a few of them on each page and I didn’t want the viewer to have to scroll a lot to see the thumbnails.  I also made the thumbnails large enough so that the viewer could see what the content of the photo was without viewing it full size, but small enough so that the eye could browse over the images easily and look at many things at once.   If the viewer would like a larger view of the photo, they can simply click on it and view it on its own page.  To have all of the photos full size on the category page would be difficult to look at because the actual size of the photos is almost bigger than the size of the browser window.  I wanted to fit a lot of thumbnail pictures on one page so I made the margins small and close to the edge to utilize all the space I could without crowding images.  I also made the size of the thumbnails 50px wide with 5px of padding.  </p>
<p>While positioning the photos in the categories, I ran into the problem of positioning portrait and landscape photos.  I played around with different padding amounts and image sizes for either only portrait photos or only landscape photos, but it never looked right.  Eventually, my solution was to put all of the portrait photos at the bottom of the series.  Once I did that, the page had a more organized look to it because all of the photos were in the same direction and filled in an equal amount of space.  Some categories had just the right amount of photos to line up everything in an array with all the landscape photos, the majority, at the top of the page and then after that, the portrait photos would fall into line at the bottom.  
The hardest part of this project was getting the pictures into the right position so that they could be easily viewed without a chaotic layout.  There were some things that I wish I could have done on my website, but I don’t have the level of skill yet to actually apply it to this project.  </p>
