    While riding the bus tour in Havana, I was able to take some great pictures of the city and its culture and architecture. Much of the city looks as if it is stuck in the 1950's.  The cars are all either American-made from over 60 years ago, or small, cheap automobiles from countries such as Russia.  Some architecture is vibrant and extravagant while other buildings are industrial and block-y because of the Russian influence at the time of construction.
